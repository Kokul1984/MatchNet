# Deep Match Tracker: Classifying when Dissimilar, Similarity Matching when Not
## IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)- 2018


## Abstract 
Visual tracking frameworks employing Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown state-of-the-art performance
due to their hierarchical feature representation. While
classification and update based deep neural net tracking have
shown good performance in terms of accuracy, they have
poor tracking speed. On the other hand, recent matching
based techniques using CNNs show higher than real-time
speed in tracking but this speed is achieved at a considerably
lower accuracy. To successfully manage the trade-off
between accuracy and speed, we propose a novel CNN architecture
for visual tracking. We achieve this trade-off balance
by using an approach in which consecutive similar frames
are processed with a similarity matching technique, and dissimilar
frames are processed with a classification approach
within the CNN architecture. The tracking speed is improved
by avoiding unnecessary model updates through the measurement
of similarity between adjacent frames, while the
accuracy is maintained by adopting a classification approach
when needed, with deeper level features. Extensive evaluation
performed on a publicly available benchmark dataset
demonstrates our proposed tracker shows competitive performance
while maintaining near real-time speed.
